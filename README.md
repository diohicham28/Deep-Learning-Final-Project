# Deep-Learning-Final-Project
I've compared and contrasted the performance of two prominent pre-trained models: MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0

# Advanced Deep Learning Exploration

Welcome to the Advanced Deep Learning Exploration Colab notebook repository!

## Overview

This repository contains Colab notebooks showcasing my exploration into advanced deep learning techniques. Through this project, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of modern neural network architectures, data augmentation, and model evaluation. I focused on comparing the performance of MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0 pre-trained models while experimenting with various strategies to optimize their effectiveness.

## Key Features

- Comparative analysis of MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0
- Implementation of data augmentation for improved model robustness
- Neural network architecture design and optimization
- Detailed performance metrics and visualization of results

## Getting Started

1. Open the Colab notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to see the analysis and experiments.
   
2. Click on the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of each notebook to launch it in Google Colab.
